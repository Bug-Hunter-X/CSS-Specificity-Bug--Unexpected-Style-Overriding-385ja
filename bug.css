The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected results if not carefully managed.  For example, consider the following scenario:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myId {
  color: green;
}

#myId.myClass {
  color: purple;
}

#myId.myClass div {
  color: yellow; /* This will be the final color */
}
```

In this example, the `#myId.myClass div` selector is highly specific. Even if an element has classes and an ID, and is nested within a `div`, the most specific selector wins. This behavior is often unexpected, especially when dealing with complex CSS structures and inherited styles.
