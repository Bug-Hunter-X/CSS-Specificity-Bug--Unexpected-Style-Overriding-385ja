# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue with CSS specificity.  Highly specific selectors can unintentionally override other styles, leading to unexpected visual results. The `bug.css` file shows the problem, and `bugSolution.css` offers a possible solution.

## Problem

The main challenge is managing the cascading order of CSS selectors.  The provided CSS demonstrates how a highly specific selector unexpectedly takes precedence over styles intended for parent elements or elements with fewer applied classes and IDs.
