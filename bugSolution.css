One approach to solve the unexpected specificity issues is to refactor the CSS to reduce the specificity of the conflicting selectors. Another approach is to use the `!important` flag, but this should be used sparingly as it can have negative side effects:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myId {
  color: green;
}

#myId.myClass {
  color: purple;
}

/*Solution 1: Refactor for less specificity*/
#myId {
  color: green !important;
}
/*Solution 2: Use !important (use sparingly)*/
#myId.myClass div {
  color: yellow;
}
```

By carefully structuring your CSS and employing techniques such as BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) or OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS), you can mitigate the likelihood of these problems arising.
